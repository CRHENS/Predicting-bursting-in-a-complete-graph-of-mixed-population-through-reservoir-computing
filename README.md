Code1_JJ_Smulation.m: It simulates the network of oscillatory Josephson junction for different coupling strength.
Code2_ML_feedingonenode.m: Describes how the ECho State network works when  one oscillatory  input is fed into the machine.
Code3_plot_MSE_forallnodes_diff_coup: Plot the mean squared error data when one input is fed into the machine.
